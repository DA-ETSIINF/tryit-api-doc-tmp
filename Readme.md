# TryIT API OpenAPI Documentation Specification

OpenAPI Documentation for the TryIT! Congress' Restful API is defined in `openapi.yaml`. 
`redoc-static.html` is a static html file generated by [redoc-cli](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc#redoc-cli). 

## Working with the repo

First, clone the repo using your favorite terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/DA-ETSIINF/tryit-api-doc-tmp.git`

Then, [download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (you can hate me later). Ensure NPM is being installed too (No, you can't hate me yet). Now, install redoc-cli:

`npm i -g redoc-cli`

Usage information can be found [here](https://redoc.ly/docs/redoc/quickstart/cli/). After modifying `openapi.yaml` you can convert it to a static html file by running the following command:

`redoc-cli bundle --output index.html openapi.yaml`

Now you can hate me, but jokes on you because you can't hate me more than I hate JS.
